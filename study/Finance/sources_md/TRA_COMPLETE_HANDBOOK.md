# PART 1 — FOUNDATIONS OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

## 1.1 What technical analysis really is
**Technical analysis (TA)** is the study of **price and volume data** — usually on charts — to forecast the *future direction* of a market. It does not care *what* a company does or *whether* it is "cheap." It only studies **how the price has behaved** and what that implies next.

A technical analyst believes the chart already contains the collective decisions of every buyer and seller — institutions, retail, algos — and that those decisions leave **repeatable footprints** because human emotion (fear and greed) repeats.

## 1.2 The three core assumptions (the philosophy)
1. **The market discounts everything.** Every known fact — earnings, news, interest rates, sentiment — is already reflected in the price. So studying price *is* studying all of it at once.
2. **Prices move in trends.** Once a direction is established, it is more likely to continue than reverse. This is *the* reason TA works — it lets you ride trends.
3. **History repeats itself.** Chart patterns and reactions recur because mass psychology is constant across decades.

## 1.3 Technical vs Fundamental vs Quantitative
- **Fundamental analysis** answers **WHAT to buy** — it values a business (earnings, growth, debt, management, macro). Time horizon: months to years.
- **Technical analysis** answers **WHEN to buy or sell** — timing entries and exits from price behaviour. Time horizon: minutes to months.
- **Quantitative analysis** uses **statistics and code** to find and test edges systematically (your backtester sits here).
- A strong analyst blends them: *fundamentals pick the stock, technicals time the trade, quant validates the rule.*

## 1.4 Dow Theory — the foundation everything is built on
Charles Dow's six tenets are the bedrock of TA:
1. **The averages discount everything** (same as assumption 1).
2. **The market has three trends:** *Primary* (months–years, the tide), *Secondary* (weeks–months, corrective waves), *Minor* (days, ripples).
3. **Primary trends have three phases:** **Accumulation** (smart money quietly buys), **Public Participation** (trend-followers pile in, biggest move), **Distribution** (smart money sells to the late crowd).
4. **The averages must confirm each other** — e.g., an index and a related index should move together to confirm a trend.
5. **Volume must confirm the trend** — volume should expand in the direction of the primary trend.
6. **A trend stays in force until a clear reversal** — don't call a top/bottom prematurely.

## 1.5 Types of charts
- **Line chart** — connects closing prices. Clean, good for seeing the big trend.
- **Bar chart (OHLC)** — each bar shows Open, High, Low, Close.
- **Candlestick chart** — same OHLC data but visual and colour-coded; the global standard (covered in depth in Part 2).
- **Heikin-Ashi** — averaged candles that smooth noise and make trends visually obvious.
- **Renko / Point & Figure** — plot price *movement* (not time); filter out noise to highlight S/R and trends.

## 1.6 Timeframes and "multiple timeframe analysis"
The same chart looks different on different timeframes. A pro **always checks more than one**:
- **Higher timeframe (e.g., weekly/daily)** = the *context / dominant trend*.
- **Lower timeframe (e.g., hourly/15-min)** = the *entry timing*.
- **Rule:** trade in the direction of the higher timeframe trend, time the entry on the lower one. Conflicting timeframes = lower-conviction trade.

---

# PART 2 — PRICE ACTION & CHART READING

## 2.1 Candlesticks — full anatomy
Each candle covers one period and shows four prices:
- **Open** and **Close** form the **real body**.
- The thin lines above/below are **wicks / shadows**, marking the **High** and **Low**.
- **Bullish candle** (green/white): close > open. **Bearish candle** (red/black): close < open.
- **A long body** = strong conviction; **a small body** = indecision; **long wicks** = rejection of a price level.

### Single-candle patterns
- **Doji** — open ≈ close (tiny body). Indecision; potential reversal, especially after a long trend.
- **Hammer** — small body at the top, long lower wick (≥2× body). After a downtrend = **bullish reversal** (buyers rejected lower prices).
- **Hanging Man** — same shape as hammer but after an *uptrend* = bearish warning.
- **Shooting Star** — small body at bottom, long upper wick, after an uptrend = **bearish reversal**.
- **Marubozu** — full body, no wicks = extreme conviction in that direction.

### Two/three-candle patterns
- **Bullish Engulfing** — a big green candle completely engulfs the prior red body = strong bullish reversal.
- **Bearish Engulfing** — mirror image = bearish reversal.
- **Piercing Line / Dark Cloud Cover** — partial engulfing reversals.
- **Morning Star** (bullish) / **Evening Star** (bearish) — three-candle reversals: big trend candle, small indecision candle, big opposite candle.
- **Three White Soldiers / Three Black Crows** — three strong candles in a row confirming a reversal.

**Interpretation rule:** candlestick signals matter most **at a level** (support/resistance) and **with volume** — a hammer at support on high volume is far stronger than one in mid-air.

## 2.2 Support and Resistance — the most important concept in TA
- **Support** = a price zone where **demand** repeatedly overwhelms supply and stops a fall. A "floor."
- **Resistance** = a price zone where **supply** overwhelms demand and stops a rise. A "ceiling."
- **Why they exist:** memory. Traders remember prices where they bought/sold and act again there.
- **Role reversal (polarity):** once **broken**, old resistance becomes new support, and old support becomes new resistance. This is one of the most reliable behaviours in markets.
- **Types of S/R:** horizontal levels (swing highs/lows), trendlines, moving averages, Fibonacci levels, round numbers (e.g., Nifty 24,000), and pivot points.
- **Strength factors:** the more times a level is tested, the more significant it is — *but* every test drains it, and eventually it breaks.

## 2.3 Trendlines and channels
- **Uptrend line** — drawn under **higher lows**; acts as support.
- **Downtrend line** — drawn over **lower highs**; acts as resistance.
- **Channel** — two parallel trendlines containing price; buy near the lower rail, sell near the upper rail in a sideways/rising channel.
- A trendline needs **at least two touches** to draw and a **third** to confirm. A decisive break warns of a trend change.

## 2.4 Chart patterns
Chart patterns are recognisable shapes that tend to resolve in a predictable direction. They fall into **reversal** and **continuation** groups.

### Reversal patterns (trend likely to flip)
- **Head & Shoulders** — three peaks, the middle (head) highest, with a "neckline." Break below the neckline = bearish target ≈ head-to-neckline distance projected down. **Inverse H&S** = bullish bottom.
- **Double Top (M) / Double Bottom (W)** — two failed attempts at a level = reversal.
- **Triple Top / Bottom** — stronger version.
- **Rounding Top / Bottom (saucer)** — slow, gradual reversal.

### Continuation patterns (trend likely to resume)
- **Triangles:** *Ascending* (flat top, rising lows — bullish bias), *Descending* (flat bottom, falling highs — bearish bias), *Symmetrical* (converging — breakout in trend direction).
- **Flags & Pennants** — short pause after a sharp move ("flagpole"), then continuation. Target ≈ flagpole height.
- **Wedges** — rising wedge = bearish, falling wedge = bullish (counter-intuitive — learn this).
- **Rectangles** — sideways consolidation between S/R, then breakout.
- **Cup & Handle** — a rounded base then a small pullback (handle), then breakout = bullish.

### Gaps
- A **gap** is empty space where price jumps between sessions. Types: **breakaway** (starts a move), **runaway/continuation** (mid-trend), **exhaustion** (end of move), **common** (noise). Gaps often "fill" later.

# PART 3 — TECHNICAL INDICATORS (IN DEPTH)
Indicators are math applied to price/volume to make a signal clearer. They fall into four families: **trend, momentum, volatility, volume.** *Use them to confirm price action, never blindly.*

## 3.1 Trend indicators
- **Moving Average (MA):** average of the last N closes; smooths noise.
  - **SMA** weights all days equally; **EMA** weights recent days more (faster, less lag).
  - Use: price above MA = uptrend; MA slope = trend direction; MAs act as dynamic S/R.
  - **Crossovers:** short MA crossing above long MA = bullish. **Golden Cross** = 50-DMA above 200-DMA (major bullish). **Death Cross** = opposite.
- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):** (12-EMA − 26-EMA) = MACD line; its 9-EMA = signal line; the gap = histogram.
  - Bullish when MACD crosses above signal; histogram shows momentum strength; **MACD divergence** warns of reversals.
- **ADX / DMI (Average Directional Index):** measures **trend strength** (0–100), not direction. **ADX > 25 = strong trend; < 20 = weak/range.** +DI and −DI lines show direction. *Crucial because indicators like RSI work differently in trends vs ranges.*
- **Parabolic SAR:** dots that flip above/below price; trailing-stop and trend-direction tool.
- **Supertrend:** ATR-based trend line, very popular in Indian markets for intraday F&O.
- **Ichimoku Cloud:** an all-in-one system (trend, S/R, momentum) using a "cloud" (Kumo); price above the cloud = bullish.

## 3.2 Momentum indicators (oscillators)
Oscillators move within a range and flag **overbought/oversold** and **divergence**. Best in **sideways** markets.
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 0–100 (default 14). >70 overbought, <30 oversold. In strong uptrends RSI can *stay* overbought — don't short blindly. **Divergence** (price up, RSI down) is its most powerful signal. The 50 line = trend bias.
- **Stochastic Oscillator:** compares close to the high-low range (%K and %D lines), 0–100, >80/<20 zones. Good for ranges and divergence.
- **CCI (Commodity Channel Index):** measures deviation from average price; ±100 thresholds.
- **Williams %R:** like stochastic, inverted scale (0 to −100).
- **ROC / Momentum:** raw rate of price change.
- **MFI (Money Flow Index):** "volume-weighted RSI" — momentum that includes volume.

## 3.3 Volatility indicators
- **Bollinger Bands:** 20-SMA ± 2 standard deviations. Bands **widen** in volatility, **narrow** ("squeeze") before big moves. Price riding the upper band = strength; tags of the lower band in a range = bounce candidates. **Bollinger squeeze** is a classic breakout setup.
- **ATR (Average True Range):** the average daily range (true range accounts for gaps). Pure **volatility gauge** — does not give direction. Used to **size stop-losses** (e.g., 1.5–2× ATR) and position sizing so each trade risks a similar amount.
- **Keltner Channels:** like Bollinger but ATR-based; squeeze strategies combine both.
- **Donchian Channels:** highest high / lowest low over N periods — the basis of classic breakout systems.

## 3.4 Volume indicators
*Volume is the fuel; price is the car.* Moves on rising volume are trustworthy.
- **OBV (On-Balance Volume):** cumulative volume (added on up days, subtracted on down days); confirms trends and shows accumulation/distribution via divergence.
- **VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price):** the average price weighted by volume during the day — institutions benchmark fills against it; a key **intraday** S/R level.
- **Volume Profile:** shows volume **by price level** (not time), revealing high-volume nodes (strong S/R) and the **Point of Control (POC)**.
- **A/D Line (Accumulation/Distribution)** and **Chaikin Money Flow (CMF):** measure buying vs selling pressure.

## 3.5 Fibonacci tools
Based on the ratios 0.236, 0.382, 0.5, 0.618 (golden ratio), 0.786.
- **Fibonacci Retracement:** after a move, pullbacks often reverse at these % levels. **38.2%–61.8%** is the key zone; 61.8% is the most watched.
- **Fibonacci Extension:** projects targets beyond the prior move (1.272, 1.618) — used to set profit targets.
- **Confluence:** Fib levels lining up with S/R or a moving average = high-probability zone.

## 3.6 Pivot points
Calculated from the prior day's High, Low, Close: a central **Pivot (P)** plus support (S1, S2, S3) and resistance (R1, R2, R3) levels. Hugely popular **intraday** for indices and F&O; price above P = bullish bias for the day.

## 3.7 The golden rule of indicators
**Indicators lag — price leads.** Use 2–3 *non-redundant* indicators (e.g., one trend + one momentum + volume), look for **confluence**, and let **price action at key levels** make the final call. Stacking five momentum indicators that all say the same thing is false confidence.

# PART 4 — MARKET THEORIES & FRAMEWORKS

## 4.1 Divergence (master this)
**Divergence** = price and an oscillator (RSI/MACD) disagree.
- **Regular bearish divergence:** price makes a **higher high**, indicator makes a **lower high** → uptrend weakening, possible top.
- **Regular bullish divergence:** price makes a **lower low**, indicator makes a **higher low** → downtrend weakening, possible bottom.
- **Hidden divergence:** signals trend *continuation* (e.g., price higher low, indicator lower low in an uptrend = trend resumes).

## 4.2 Elliott Wave Theory
Markets move in repetitive **wave cycles** driven by crowd psychology:
- A trend unfolds in **5 waves** (1-2-3-4-5, "impulse") followed by a **3-wave correction** (A-B-C).
- Waves are **fractal** (the same pattern appears on every timeframe).
- Powerful but subjective; used to anticipate where a move is in its life-cycle.

## 4.3 The Wyckoff Method
Explains how "smart money" operates through cycles: **Accumulation → Markup → Distribution → Markdown.** Teaches you to read **accumulation/distribution ranges**, springs (false breakdowns), and the relationship between price and volume to follow institutional footprints.

## 4.4 Market cycles & sector rotation
- Markets cycle with the economy: early-cycle, mid, late, recession. Different **sectors** lead at each stage (e.g., financials early, energy/materials late, defensives in downturns).
- **Relative strength analysis** (comparing a stock/sector to the index) tells you what's leading — analysts rotate coverage toward leaders.

## 4.5 Sentiment & breadth
- **India VIX** — the "fear gauge"; high VIX = fear/volatility, often near bottoms.
- **Put-Call Ratio (PCR)** — options sentiment (covered in Part 5).
- **Market breadth** — **Advance/Decline line**, % of stocks above their 200-DMA, new highs vs new lows. Breadth confirms or warns against an index move (a rally on narrow breadth is fragile).

---

# PART 5 — DERIVATIVES: FUTURES & OPTIONS (F&O)
*Your D.E. Shaw desk was F&O — expect deep questions here.*

## 5.1 What derivatives are
A **derivative** derives its value from an **underlying** (stock, index, commodity). Used for **hedging, speculation, and leverage**. Traded in **lots** (fixed quantity), with monthly/weekly **expiries**.

## 5.2 Futures
- A **futures contract** is a binding agreement to buy/sell the underlying at a set price on a future date.
- **Long futures** = bullish; **short futures** = bearish. Leverage via **margin** (you post a fraction of contract value).
- **Basis** = futures price − spot price. **Contango** = futures > spot (normal); **Backwardation** = futures < spot (often tight supply, common in commodities).
- **Cost of carry** = interest + storage − dividends; explains the futures-spot gap.
- **Rollover** — moving a position to the next expiry; high rollover % signals trend conviction.

## 5.3 Options — the core
An **option** is the **right, not the obligation**, to buy/sell the underlying at a **strike price** before/at **expiry**, for a **premium**.
- **Call option** = right to **buy** → bought when **bullish**.
- **Put option** = right to **sell** → bought when **bearish**.
- **Buyer** pays premium, has limited risk (premium) and unlimited upside. **Seller (writer)** receives premium, has limited profit but large risk.

### Moneyness
- **ITM (In-the-Money):** has intrinsic value (call strike < spot; put strike > spot).
- **ATM (At-the-Money):** strike ≈ spot.
- **OTM (Out-of-the-Money):** no intrinsic value, only time value.
- **Premium = Intrinsic value + Time value.** Time value decays to zero by expiry.

## 5.4 The Option Greeks (know all five)
- **Delta** — change in option price per ₹1 move in the underlying (also ≈ probability of expiring ITM). Calls 0→1, puts 0→−1.
- **Gamma** — the rate of change of delta; highest for ATM options near expiry (the "acceleration").
- **Theta** — **time decay**: how much value the option loses each day. Negative for buyers, positive for sellers.
- **Vega** — sensitivity to a 1% change in **implied volatility**. Long options are long vega.
- **Rho** — sensitivity to interest rates (least important intraday).

## 5.5 Implied Volatility (IV) — you worked on IV surfaces
- **IV** is the market's **expectation of future volatility**, backed out of option prices (via Black-Scholes). High IV → expensive options.
- **IV vs HV:** implied (forward-looking) vs historical/realised (backward-looking).
- **IV Rank / IV Percentile** — where current IV sits versus its own past range; tells you if options are "cheap" or "expensive."
- **Volatility Skew / Smile** — IV differs across strikes; equity index puts usually have higher IV (crash protection demand). Plotting IV across strikes **and** expiries gives the **volatility surface** (your project).
- **Trading logic:** buy options when IV is low, sell premium when IV is high.

## 5.6 Open Interest (OI) & option-chain analysis
- **Open Interest** = total outstanding contracts. **Rising OI + rising price** = fresh longs (strong); **rising OI + falling price** = fresh shorts; **falling OI** = unwinding.
- **Option chain** = the full grid of calls/puts by strike with price, OI, IV, volume.
- **Put-Call Ratio (PCR)** = put OI ÷ call OI. **PCR > 1** = bearish positioning (often contrarian bullish); **< 0.7** = bullish/greedy.
- **Support/Resistance from OI:** the strike with the **highest call OI** acts as resistance; **highest put OI** acts as support.
- **Max Pain** = the strike where option buyers lose the most / writers gain the most; price often gravitates there near expiry.

## 5.7 Core option strategies
- **Covered Call** — hold stock + sell a call: income, caps upside.
- **Protective Put** — hold stock + buy a put: insurance.
- **Long Straddle** — buy call + put at the **same strike**: profit from a **big move either way** (event/earnings plays); needs a move bigger than the combined premium.
- **Long Strangle** — same idea with **different OTM strikes**: cheaper, needs a bigger move.
- **Bull Call Spread / Bear Put Spread** — buy one option, sell another to **reduce cost** and cap risk/reward.
- **Iron Condor** — sell an OTM call spread + put spread: profit when price stays **range-bound** (income in low volatility).
- **Butterfly** — bet on price pinning a specific strike.

# PART 6 — COMMODITIES
*The JD's first line is "Analyze Commodity, Futures & Options."*

## 6.1 The Indian commodity market
- Traded mainly on the **MCX (Multi Commodity Exchange)**; agri commodities on **NCDEX**.
- Categories: **Bullion** (gold, silver), **Energy** (crude oil, natural gas), **Base metals** (copper, zinc, aluminium, lead), **Agri** (cotton, soybean, etc.).
- Indian prices **track global benchmarks** and adjust for the **USD/INR** rate.

## 6.2 Gold
- **Drivers:** the **US dollar** (inverse — strong USD weakens gold), **real interest rates** (rising real yields hurt gold, which pays no income), **inflation** (hedge), **safe-haven demand** in crises, and central-bank buying.
- Benchmark: **COMEX** (USD/oz); Indian MCX gold also moves with **USD/INR** and import duty.

## 6.3 Silver
- Part precious metal, part **industrial** (solar, electronics) → more volatile than gold. The **gold-silver ratio** is watched for relative value.

## 6.4 Crude Oil
- Benchmarks: **WTI** (US) and **Brent** (global). **Drivers:** **OPEC+** supply decisions, geopolitics (Middle East), global demand/growth, US inventory data (EIA), and the USD.
- **Contango/backwardation** in the futures curve signals supply tightness.

## 6.5 Natural gas & base metals
- **Natural gas** — extremely volatile, weather-driven (heating/cooling demand).
- **Copper ("Dr. Copper")** — a barometer of global economic health due to its industrial use.

## 6.6 Cross-asset & seasonality
- Commodities have **seasonal** tendencies (e.g., gold demand around Indian festivals/weddings; gas in winter).
- Same TA toolkit (trend, S/R, RSI, MACD, MAs, Fibonacci) applies directly to commodity charts.

---

# PART 7 — INDICES & THE BROADER MARKET

## 7.1 Indian indices
- **Nifty 50** — 50 largest, most liquid NSE stocks; the national benchmark.
- **Sensex** — BSE's 30-stock benchmark.
- **Bank Nifty** — 12 major banks; **more volatile**, the most traded F&O index in India.
- **Fin Nifty, Nifty Midcap, Nifty Next 50,** and **sectoral indices** (IT, Pharma, Auto, FMCG, Metal) — used for sector rotation and relative strength.

## 7.2 Global cues
- **GIFT Nifty (formerly SGX Nifty)** — signals the likely opening of Nifty based on overnight global moves.
- **US indices** — **Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq**; **Asian** (Nikkei, Hang Seng) and **European** opens set the tone.
- **Dollar Index (DXY), US 10-year yield, crude, and FII/DII flows** all drive Indian markets.

## 7.3 Volatility & breadth
- **India VIX** — expected 30-day volatility; spikes in fear.
- **Advance/Decline, % above 200-DMA, new highs/lows** — breadth gauges that confirm index health.

---

# PART 8 — RISK & TRADE MANAGEMENT
*This is what separates a professional from a gambler. Interviewers test it hard.*

## 8.1 The stop-loss
A **stop-loss** is a pre-decided exit price that caps your loss if you're wrong. **Non-negotiable.** Types:
- **Fixed % stop**, **level-based stop** (below support), **ATR/volatility stop**, **moving-average stop**, **time stop**.
- **Trailing stop** — moves with price to lock in profit while letting winners run.

## 8.2 Risk:Reward and R-multiples
- **Risk:Reward (R:R)** = potential reward ÷ potential risk. Demand **≥ 1:2** so you can be right less than half the time and still profit.
- **R-multiple** — express every result in units of initial risk (R). A trade that makes 3× your risk = +3R. Thinking in R keeps you objective.

## 8.3 Position sizing
- **Risk a fixed small % of capital per trade** (commonly 1–2%). Position size = (capital × risk%) ÷ (entry − stop). This ensures no single trade can hurt you and that volatile instruments get smaller size (via wider stops).

## 8.4 Portfolio-level risk
- **Diversification & correlation** — don't hold five positions that are really the same bet (e.g., all bank stocks + Bank Nifty).
- **Max drawdown discipline, exposure limits, and avoiding over-leverage** in F&O (leverage cuts both ways).

## 8.5 The money-management rules pros live by
Cut losses quickly, let winners run, never add to a loser hoping it recovers, size to volatility, and **survive first — returns come second.**

---

# PART 9 — RESEARCH REPORT WRITING & RECOMMENDATIONS
*Your actual daily output as a TRA.*

## 9.1 Report cadence
- **Daily** — pre-market note: overnight global cues, key levels for Nifty/Bank Nifty/commodities, top trade ideas.
- **Weekly** — trend review, sector view, positional calls.
- **Monthly** — bigger-picture market outlook and themes.

## 9.2 Anatomy of a good call
Every recommendation must state: **Instrument · View (Buy/Sell/Hold) · Entry · Target(s) · Stop-loss · Time horizon · Rationale.**
- The **rationale** ties together trend, levels, indicators, and (for F&O) OI/IV.
- Always give a **stop** and an honest **risk:reward** — a call without a stop is unprofessional.

## 9.3 Communicating to clients & RMs
- Be **clear and concise** — RMs relay to clients who aren't technical. Lead with the call, then the reason.
- Talk in **probabilities, not certainties** ("favourable risk-reward to go long above X," not "this will go up").
- **Track and own your calls** — record hit/miss; credibility is built on a transparent track record.

---

# PART 10 — BACKTESTING & QUANTITATIVE BASICS
*Your differentiator — but you must understand it, not just run it.*

## 10.1 What backtesting is
Applying a **rules-based strategy to historical data** to estimate how it would have performed — to validate an edge **before** risking capital.

## 10.2 Methodology & pitfalls
- **No look-ahead bias** — only use data available at decision time (act on *yesterday's* signal).
- **Survivorship bias** — include delisted names, or results are too rosy.
- **Overfitting (curve-fitting)** — tuning a strategy so perfectly to the past that it fails live. Guard with **out-of-sample testing** and **walk-forward analysis**.
- **Costs** — include brokerage, slippage, and taxes, or live results disappoint.

## 10.3 Performance metrics (define each)
- **CAGR** — smoothed annual growth rate.
- **Sharpe ratio** — excess return ÷ total volatility; risk-adjusted return. >1 good, >2 excellent.
- **Sortino ratio** — like Sharpe but only penalises **downside** volatility (fairer).
- **Maximum Drawdown** — worst peak-to-trough loss; measures pain/risk of ruin.
- **Win rate** — % of profitable trades (high win rate ≠ profitable if losses are huge).
- **Profit factor** — gross profit ÷ gross loss; >1 = profitable.
- **Exposure** — % of time invested.
- **Calmar ratio** — CAGR ÷ max drawdown.

## 10.4 Statistics you should know
- **Mean, median, standard deviation** (volatility = std of returns), **normal distribution & fat tails** (markets have more extreme moves than "normal" predicts), **correlation** (−1 to +1), **mean reversion vs momentum**, and **probability/expectancy** = (win% × avg win) − (loss% × avg loss).

---

# PART 11 — REGULATION, COMPLIANCE & ETHICS

## 11.1 NISM Series-XV: Research Analyst
The **SEBI-mandated certification** required to legally publish research/recommendations in India. It covers TA, fundamentals, valuation, and — importantly — **regulations and ethics**.

## 11.2 SEBI (Research Analysts) Regulations — key duties
- **Disclosure of conflicts** — reveal any holding or interest in a recommended security.
- **No front-running** — never trade ahead of your own published research.
- **Separation** of research from trading/dealing and investment-banking functions.
- **Rational basis & records** — recommendations must be justified and documented; maintain research records.
- **Fair dealing** — no misleading claims, no guaranteed returns, suitability in mind.

## 11.3 Why it matters in interviews
Showing you understand **disclosures, conflict management, and that research must be compliant** signals maturity beyond just chart-reading.

---

# PART 12 — BEHAVIOURAL FINANCE & MARKET PSYCHOLOGY
Markets are driven by **fear and greed**; TA is, at heart, the study of crowd psychology.
- **The emotional cycle:** optimism → euphoria (tops) → anxiety → panic/capitulation (bottoms) → hope → optimism.
- **Common biases to know:** **herd mentality**, **FOMO**, **loss aversion** (holding losers, cutting winners early), **confirmation bias** (seeing only what supports your view), **anchoring**, **recency bias**, and **overconfidence**.
- **The professional edge** is *discipline* — a written plan, predefined stops, and the emotional control to follow them when the crowd panics.

---

# PART 13 — TOOLS OF THE TRADE
- **Charting:** **TradingView** (industry standard), broker terminals, MetaTrader, and pro terminals like **Bloomberg / Refinitiv (Reuters)**.
- **Data & screening:** NSE/MCX option chains, **Chartink / screeners**, Excel for tracking and models.
- **Coding (your edge):** **Python** (pandas, yfinance, matplotlib) for backtesting, screening, and automating reports — exactly what your projects demonstrate.
- **Knowing the workflow:** pre-market prep → global cues + levels → intraday monitoring → end-of-day report → calls tracking.

---

# PART 14 — COMMON TRADING SETUPS (putting it together)
- **Trend-following / pullback:** in an uptrend, buy a dip to a moving average or support with the trend.
- **Breakout:** enter when price clears a key level/range on rising volume; stop just inside the range.
- **Reversal:** trade a confirmed reversal pattern + divergence at a major level (higher risk).
- **Mean-reversion:** in a range, fade extremes (buy oversold support, sell overbought resistance).
- **Momentum:** buy strength/relative-strength leaders; ride until momentum fades.
- **Event/volatility (F&O):** straddles/strangles around results or events when a big move is expected.
- **Every setup needs:** a trigger, an entry, a **stop**, a target, and a reason. No exceptions.

# QUICK REVISION — THE ANALYST'S MENTAL CHECKLIST
1. What's the **trend** on the higher timeframe?
2. Where are the key **support/resistance** levels?
3. What do **price action / candles** say at those levels?
4. Do **indicators** (one trend + one momentum + volume) confirm? Any **divergence**?
5. For F&O: what do **OI, PCR and IV** say?
6. Define the trade: **entry, target, stop, risk:reward, horizon.**
7. **Size** the position to risk a small fixed % .
8. Write the call **clearly with a rationale** — and **track** it.
